                            <p>Genesys Pulse 8.5.106+ can import and export Pulse dashboards and wallboards from one
                                environment to another which enable users to package them and share them across
                                environment.
                                <br>
                                We are currently using this approach to help administrators speed up the deployment
                                phase. <br>
                                To import a dashboard into your environment, you need to download the dashboard from the
                                Dashboard Community Center and import the json file into your Pulse environment.<br><br>

                            <h3 header>Why do I need to select agents and objects after importing dashboards?</h3>
                            <p>When you import Pulse dashboard into your own environment, Pulse collects all the
                                metadata
                                related to the dashboards including the widgets with the list of agents, agent groups or
                                related
                                objects and its respective metrics.<br>
                                It often happens that your environment does not have the same objects in the Genesys
                                configuration as the one who shared the dashboard, therefore the user must
                                elect its own objects in its own Genesys configuration environment.</p>

                            <p>Everyone can submit a request to share best practice dashboard on the Genesys Community
                                Center but it has to be reviewed by the Genesys Team responsible for maintaining the
                                website.<br>
                                The reason is to ensure the consistency of the presentation layer to easily navigate
                                through the dashboard related information and keep it simple for new users.

                            <p>The Stars are being used to rank the business relevance of the dashboards. It doesn't

                                but they should be used for specific cases. The ranking is also related to the ease of
                                generalization for this dashboard, i.e the more scenarios can be used with this
                                dashboard, the higher is the ranking. The ranking is being defined by the Genesys Team
                                responsible for the maintenance of the website.

                                A visualization plugin is packaged as a jar file and can be downloaded from the Dashboard Community Center.<br>
                                To be visible from your Pulse environment, you must deploy the visualization plugin into the Pulse application <i>(usually in the 'webapp/WEB-INF-lib folder')</i>.<br>
                                Once deployed and restarted, you should be able to change the visualization in the option menu of the widget.
