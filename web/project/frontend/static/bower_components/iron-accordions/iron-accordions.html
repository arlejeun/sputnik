[*Github Repo*](https://github.com/alijaya/iron-accordions)

For creating accordion like layout. Use it with `<iron-accordion>` please.
Note that this thing has *s*, and the child doesn't have *s*.
I know this is confusing, but you need to blame it to the creator of `<paper-tabs>` and `<paper-tab>`.

One more thing, this element extends `Polymer.IronMultiSelectableBehavior`, so you can add `multi` attribute if you want it.

Example:

    <iron-accordions>
      <iron-accordion>
        <h2 header>This is the Header</h2>
        <p>This is a paragraph</p>
        <p>And more paragraph here</p>
      </iron-accordion>
      <iron-accordion>
        <h2 header>Compound Header</h2>
        <p header>Yeah</p>
        <p>I don't like writing a documentation</p>
        <p>YEAH!!!</p>
      </iron-accordion>
    <iron-accordions>
