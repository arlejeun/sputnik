==========
See the [component page](http://bendavis78.github.io/paper-chip/) for full
documentation.

`paper-chip` is a small [Polymer](http://polymer-project.org) element that
represents a complex entity such as a calendar event or a contact. The chip can
be in an opened or closed state. In its closed state, it contains an icon and a
short title. In its open state, the chip expands to show more detail about the
represented entity, as well as (optionally) a "remove" button that removes the
chip element from the DOM.
